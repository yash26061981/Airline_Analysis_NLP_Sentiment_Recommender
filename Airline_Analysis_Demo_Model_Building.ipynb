            "Texts : [[b' I got a very warm greeting from the flight attendant when entering the aircraft and selection of welcome drink  I choose champagne  The Sky Chef came out to offer the lunch menu and drink  I choose Cod fish and Italian dry white wine  which was very good  I have to say that the meal was beyond my expectation  Flight attendant was very attentive  often came to fill up my wine and very nice personality  asking me if I did enjoy the flight or not  When arrived to Bahrain  I used the Falcon Gold lounge waiting for my next flight to Frankfurt  The lounge is large  choices of meals and drinks  Meal in the lounge taste quite good  I took beef stew and deep fried chicken  Drinks  a lot of choice from juice to beer  wine and champagne too  Again flight from Bahrain to Frankfurt  They use smaller aircraft  A     but seat is comfortable and large space  Since it was a late night flight  So  I was serve only light meal and choose Garden Salad and drink champagne  I think that it was nice salad and meal was not too much for late night flight  Breakfast was served   hour before landing  I choose omelet and hot coffee  Seat on Falcon Gold is very nice and comfortable  I have looked for my next trip to Frankfurt in November and I see that Gulf Air will change aircraft from A    to B    which B    has new modern seat configuration too  Base on some negative review of Gulf Air which I read before  first  made me quite unsure about to fly with them but I would definitely fly with them again ']\n",
            " [b' It was such a pleasant flight although I wish the cabin temperature had been coler  Food and drink is on demand  and of a good quality  The transfer arrangements at Dubai airport were well organised and everything ran smoothly  I will be using this airline as much as I can in the future ']\n",
            " [b' Recently I decided to start using Delta Airlines  It was a fairly last minute trip so I scheduled a flight from Detroit to Tampa and paid around       I scheduled the      PM because I didn t know what time I would be done with work  It turned out my assignment ended early so I got to the airport at  PM to try to get on a     PM flight  At first I was informed there would be a     fee to change to the earlier flight which was fine with me and well worth it  Then after looking up my fare the Delta employee told me that I could not change the flight because I had an economy fare  The only option was to buy a new ticket for close to      on the      flight  I asked if I could go standby they said no  I asked if there was anything I could do to get on the earlier flight short of paying another full fare  They said  sorry but you purchasd the cheap fare and Delta tries to make as much as they can   So the      flight was delayed until       I hung around hoping I could get on the flight  I tried again and Delta said that if the      is delayed then they would allow me to get on the earlier flight  I asked them to check and they said it was not delayed   sorry  Once everyone boarded the earlier flight I tried again and they said they could not put me on the flight even though there was plenty of extra seats  The later flight is not delayed and that is the only way they would allow it  The flight left  Not    minutes goes by and I get an email saying the      is delayed  Delta Airlines does not care about accommodating its passengers  They could have put me on that earlier flight and made an extra     but they chose to be greedy and make me sit in the airport for another   hours  My flight has been delayed to      and I am betting it will be later than that  Fly Southwest   they are the best when it comes to making changes to your flight  They are very accommodating easy to deal with and generally care about their passengers  I will not fly Delta again ']] \n",
